I remember family gatherings with a mix of emotions. Joy, because those get-togethers were always a symbol of unity, laughter, and sharing. But also a gentle nostalgia, knowing that many of those moments will never come back. In Mozambique, we have a deeply hospitable culture and place great value on community and togetherness. Whenever there’s an opportunity to celebrate, we do so wholeheartedly, with enthusiasm and without limits.<br><br>

When I was younger, I used to spend weekends and special occasions at my grandfather’s house. The whole family gathered: we ate delicious food, laughed, danced, and celebrated life.<br><br>
Those moments taught me something essential — that we must cherish both the small and the big joys, because life only truly makes sense when it is shared with the people we love most.<br><br>
